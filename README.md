# Misery-Business
This mod aims to make the survival in 7 Days to Die a bit harder. The purpose isn't really to create new mechanics into the game but to make the player think other ways of doing things that could be more efficient. The player character isn't as fitted for the survival whereas the zombies are more fierce. Items aren't often as effective and many buffs have been weakened. Traders require more quests to advance and the rewards are usually worse. Overall, things are looking quite a bit more miserable.

This modpack is completely Xml-based, which means it can be installed into a server without requiring the users do the same; it's a server-side mod. It is also divided into smaller sections for you to easily choose which parts of it you want to include in your game.
