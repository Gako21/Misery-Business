# Misery-Business
This mod aims to make the survival in 7 Days to Die a bit harder. The purpose isn't really to create new mechanics into the game but to make the player think other ways of doing things that could be more efficient. The player character isn't as fitted for the survival whereas the zombies are more fierce. Items aren't often as effective and many buffs have been weakened. Overall, things are looking quite a bit more miserable.

This modpack is completely Xml-based, which means it can be installed into a server without requiring the users do the same; it's a server-side mod. It is also divided into smaller sections for you to easily choose which parts of it you want to include in your game.

Some of the main modifications for the player include:
- Lower movement speed.
- Lower stamina and health regeneration.
- Higher food and water consumption.
- Lower carrying capacity (before being overweight).

Some of the main modifications for zombies include:
- Removed knockdown completely
- Increased feral sense range
- Increased pain resist and movement speeds
- Increased health and radiated health regen.
- Increased chance of inflicting a debuff
- Decreased exp gain

Some of the main modifications for items include:
- Reduced mod slots
- Reduced mod value increase and made it %-based instead
- Reduced healing values across the board
- Reduced duration and intensity of various medical items
- Lowered food, water and health gains on most, if not all, foods and drinks
- Added dysentery chance to canned food


Things I have yet to do:
- Modify stat display for canned foods with water in them.
- Modify quest rewards.
- Modify some loot containers.
